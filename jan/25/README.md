# Welcome!

Today, we're going to make sure your system is all set to dive in tomorrow. You should have the following files, either from this repo, from a provided thumb drive, or from the internet at large:

* [An editor](https://github.com/TIY-DC-ROR-2015-Jan/course-notes/blob/master/prework.md#install-a-text-editor) of your choosing
* The OSX command line tools (try typing `gcc` to start an installer if needed)
* `mic_check.rb`

## Testing

I'll talk you through the actual installation process, but you can run `./path/to/mic_check.rb` to test your system setup at any time. Heed any warnings, but if it's says you're good to go, you're good to go!

## When You're Doneâ€¦

* close this issue (or tag it 'help wanted' or 'needs review')
* take a look at the source `mic_check.rb` - how does it work?
